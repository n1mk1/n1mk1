## 🔹 Interests  

### 🔹 Financial & Physics Simulations  
Applying **computational methods** to real-world scenarios, such as **processing large datasets** and **visualizing them through physics simulations**.  

### 🔹 4X Strategy Games  
Games like *Civilization 7* and *Frostpunk* push me to manage **multiple ideas and datasets simultaneously**.  

### 🔹 PC Building  
I relish convincing people to build PCs, knowing I’ll be the one assembling them.  

### 🔹 Stock Market & Industry Trends  
I have deep knowledge of the PC hardware market and the gaming industry—mostly from PC Part Picker fantasy builds and binging YouTube videos.
I love analyzing hardware price fluctuations, all in the hopes of one day flexing 128GB of RAM to my friends.
